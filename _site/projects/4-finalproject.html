<h3 id="description-plot">Description Plot</h3>

<p><strong>Plot 1: Total Electric Vehicle Sales by Model Year</strong>
<img src="/assets/images/plot1.png" alt="Total Electric Vehicle Sales by Model Year" style="width: 100%" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The bar plot illustrates the total electric vehicle sales by model year. It shows a clear trend of increasing sales over the years, with particular spikes in certain years, which likely correspond to the introduction of popular models or increased adoption due to other factors like improvements in infrastructure, technology, or government incentives.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plot 2: Top Electric Vehicle Models by Year</strong>
<img src="/assets/images/plot2.png" alt="Total Electric Vehicle Sales by Model Year" style="width: 100%" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Here is the line plot showing the count of the top electric vehicle models by model year. Each line represents one of the top models, and the trend in their counts over the years is visible. You can see how some models have gained popularity over time, especially recent models like the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plot 3: Average Electric Range for different car ‘Make’ with corresponding ‘Models’</strong>
<img src="/assets/images/plot3.png" alt="Total Electric Vehicle Sales by Model Year" style="width: 100%" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The horizontal bar plots display the average electric range for each model within the top makes. Each subplot corresponds to one of the top makes, and the models are sorted by their average electric range. This visualization helps in comparing the electric range within the lineup of each make.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plot 4: Number of Models for each ‘Make’</strong>
<img src="/assets/images/plot4.png" alt="Total Electric Vehicle Sales by Model Year" style="width: 100%" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The bar plot shows the number of models available for each make. Makes with a wider range of models are on the left, indicating a larger portfolio of electric vehicles, while those with fewer models are on the right. This visualization provides an insight into the diversity of electric vehicles offered by different manufacturers.​</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plot 5: Top Model Location in 2023 and later</strong>
<img src="/assets/images/plot5.png" alt="Total Electric Vehicle Sales by Model Year" style="width: 100%" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Data Filtering: The dataset is filtered to include only records where the ‘State’ is ‘WA’ (Washington) and the ‘Model Year’ is 2023 or later. This step ensures that the analysis focuses on recent EV registrations in Washington.</li>
  <li>Identifying the Top Model: Among these filtered records, the code identifies the most popular EV model based on the number of registrations. The value_counts() method is used to count occurrences of each model, and the top one is selected.</li>
  <li>The resulting map should show the locations of the top EV model in Washington state as of 2023, overlaid on a basemap for better geographic context. This analysis is useful for understanding the popularity and distribution of this EV model in Washington.</li>
</ul>
