</ul>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="contextual-datasets">Contextual Datasets</h3>

<p>The <strong>“Electric_Vehicle_Title_and_Registration_Activity.csv”</strong> dataset shows records of title activity (transactions recording changes of ownership), and registration activity (transactions authorizing vehicles to be used on Washington public roads). Here is the official link: https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Title-and-Registration-Activity/rpr4-cgyd</p>

<p>It provides detailed information about title and registration activities for electric vehicles, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Type:</strong> Type of electric vehicle (e.g., Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)).</li>
  <li><strong>VIN (Vehicle Identification Number):</strong> Partial VIN numbers for individual vehicles.</li>
  <li><strong>DOL Vehicle ID, Model Year, Make, Model:</strong> Identifying and descriptive details of the vehicle.</li>
  <li><strong>Vehicle Primary Use:</strong> The primary use of the vehicle (e.g., Passenger).</li>
  <li><strong>Specifications:</strong> Electric Range, Odometer Reading.</li>
  <li><strong>Odometer Code:</strong> Type of odometer reading (e.g., Actual Mileage).</li>
  <li><strong>Registration and Title Details:</strong> Including transaction type, transaction date, and transaction price.</li>
  <li><strong>Legislative and Utility Information:</strong> Legislative District, Electric Utility.</li>
</ul>

<p>This dataset <strong>“Electric_Vehicle_Title_and_Registration_Activity.csv”</strong>, as one contexual dataset, complements the “Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv” by providing more dynamic information such as odometer readings, transaction types, and dates, which reflect the usage and transaction history of electric vehicles. Given the content of both datasets, here are some ways the second dataset (Electric Vehicle Title and Registration Activity) can support the first one (Electric Vehicle Population Data):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Vehicle Usage Insights:</strong> Odometer readings from the title and registration dataset can give insights into how much electric vehicles are being used, which can be correlated with the population data to analyze usage patterns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Transaction Trends:</strong> Understanding the transaction types and dates can help in analyzing the market dynamics, like how often electric vehicles are bought and sold, and how this trend correlates with the overall population of electric vehicles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Geographic Analysis:</strong> Both datasets include geographic information which can be used to analyze regional differences in electric vehicle adoption and usage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Model and Make Analysis:</strong> By comparing the models and makes in both datasets, one can analyze the popularity and longevity of different electric vehicle models.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Policy Impact Analysis:</strong> By correlating legislative district and utility information with vehicle types and usage, one can assess the impact of local policies on electric vehicle adoption.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Environmental Impact Assessment:</strong> The usage data (like odometer readings) combined with population data can help in estimating the environmental impact and benefits of electric vehicles in different regions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="contextual-dataset-visualization">Contextual Dataset Visualization</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/pngs/plot6.png" style="width: 100%" /></p>

<p><strong>Plot 6.1: Distribution of Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle Types</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Our first visual analysis is a count plot that illustrates the frequency distribution of different types of clean alternative fuel vehicles within the dataset. The x-axis categorizes the vehicles into different fuel types, such as Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). The y-axis quantifies the number of vehicles within each category.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Findings:
BEVs significantly outnumber PHEVs, indicating a strong market preference for fully electric vehicles over hybrids.
This trend suggests that consumers may favor the environmental benefits and potential cost savings associated with BEVs.
The infrastructure and policy-making should continue to support the growth of BEV technology, which is likely to dominate the clean vehicle market.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plot 6.2: New vs. Used Electric Vehicles</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The second visual analysis compares the number of new electric vehicles to used ones in the dataset. It categorizes vehicles on the x-axis as either ‘New’ or ‘Used’, while the y-axis represents the count of occurrences in each category.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Findings:
There is a substantial predominance of new EVs compared to used ones, implying a rapidly growing market with a high turnover of new models and technology.
The prevalence of new EVs may indicate consumer confidence in newer technologies and a potential growth area for manufacturers and dealerships.
The used EV market appears to be significantly smaller, which may suggest a lack of availability or consumer hesitation towards pre-owned electric vehicles.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Plot 7: Type of Transaction Over Time</strong>
<img src="/assets/pngs/plot7.png" style="width: 100%" /></p>

<p>This visualization showcases the types of transactions (such as original, renewal, etc.) over time, based on the ‘Transaction Year’ and ‘Transaction Type’ from the “Electric_Vehicle_Title_and_Registration_Activity” dataset. The line chart provides insights into the frequency and trends of different transaction types across the years.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Plot 8:</strong>
<img src="/assets/pngs/plot8.png" style="width: 100%" /></p>

<p>This visualization illustrates the distribution of different transaction types in the “Electric Vehicle Title and Registration Activity” dataset. This count plot provides insights into the most common types of transactions, such as original registrations, renewals, etc.</p>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The visual data analyses reveal a strong consumer inclination towards new and technologically advanced BEVs. The market shows significant potential for growth in the new vehicle sector, with less penetration in the used vehicle market. Manufacturers should capitalize on this trend to innovate and expand their BEV offerings. Meanwhile, the used EV market may require strategic initiatives to build consumer trust and expand its share. Policymakers and infrastructure planners can leverage these insights to foster an environment that supports the continued adoption of BEVs, contributing to sustainability goals.</p>
